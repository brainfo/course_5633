# Literature reading
## What is the medically relevant insight from the article?
Q: The effects patterns of genes in response of insulin in WAT and whether and how bariatric surgery would change the patterns.  
A: They stratify the genes responsive (in WAT) to insulin into common, or obese/weight-loss specific ones. And confirmed that weight-loss could normalize most gene expression perturbations. This helped narrow down the target list to improve insulin action and established the clinical merits of weight loss for obesity.
## Which genomics technology/ technologies were used?
5â€² cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE)

## List and explain at least three questions/ hypotheses you can think of that extend the analysis presented in the paper.
Q1 POB enriched genes
H1 quantification of weight loss?
H2 The possible mechanisms of genes regulated with no TF expression changes: as said in the paper, posttranscriptional events of the TFs; the genomic context changes around the promoter/enhancer of target genes; the TFs binding site can be out of the selected regions. number matters or? Or if SREBF1 and CEBPB is enough to triger the cascade. Enhancers? Loops? with the exception of SREBF1 and CEBPB, the genes encoding the corresponding TFs were not significantly regulated by insulin at the transcriptional level, suggesting that the observed TFBS activities were due to posttranscriptional events.
H3 memory studies?
